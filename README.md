# Textual Data Analysis with Natural Language Processing

Welcome to the Textual Data Analysis with Natural Language Processing repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the vast world of unstructured data and harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) to unlock its potential.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, more than 80% of the data being generated is in an unstructured format, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. This unstructured data is continuously generated through activities like writing, tweeting, social media usage, messaging, online shopping, and more, with the majority of it existing in textual form.

So, what exactly is unstructured data? Unstructured data refers to information that doesn't fit neatly into traditional relational databases. It includes a wide range of content such as documents, blogs, social media feeds, pictures, and videos. Most crucially, valuable insights are often buried within this unstructured data, making it essential for organizations to tap into its potential to make informed decisions.

## The Role of Textual Data

Textual data, the most common form of unstructured data, constitutes over 50% of this vast resource. Examples of textual data include social media posts, chat conversations, news articles, blogs, product reviews, and healthcare records. Recent advancements have introduced voice-driven bots like Siri and Alexa, which also rely on textual data for understanding and responding to user queries.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

To extract meaningful and actionable insights from textual data and make it understandable to machines, we employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques, coupled with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. NLP enables machines to comprehend and interpret human language, opening up new horizons for data analysis.
